Add builder to angular.json:

```json
{
  "storybook": {
    "builder": "@storybook/angular:start-storybook",
    "options": {
      "browserTarget": "angular-cli:build",
      "port": 6006
    }
  },
  "build-storybook": {
    "builder": "@storybook/angular:build-storybook",
    "options": {
      "browserTarget": "angular-cli:build"
    }
  }
}
```

## Run Storybook

> yarn storybook

## Used commands

### Create Component

> ng g c task

> ng g class task/task.stories --skip-tests

> ng g interface task/task

### Accessibility

> yarn add @storybook/addon-a11y

_Update Storybook configuration in .storybook/main.js and restart the Storybook Server._

### Composite component

> ng g c task-list

> ng g class task-list/task-list.stories --skip-tests

## Component-Driven Development

CDD allows us to gradually expand complexity as we move up the component hierarchy. Among the benefits are a more focused development process and increased coverage of all possible UI permutations. In short, CDD helps us build higher-quality and more complex user interfaces.

## Testing

- **Manual tests** rely on developers to manually look at a component to verify it for correctness. They help us sanity check a componentâ€™s appearance as we build.

- **Accessibility tests** with a11y addon verify that the component is accessible to everyone. They're great for allowing us to collect information about how people with certain types of disabilities use our components.

- **Interaction tests** with the play function verify that the component behaves as expected when interacting with it. They're great for testing the behavior of a component when it's in use.

- **Visual regression tests**, also called visual tests, are designed to catch changes in appearance. They work by capturing screenshots of every story and comparing them commit-to-commit to surface changes. It's perfect for verifying graphical elements like layout, color, size, and contrast.

### Test Runner

> yarn add @storybook/test-runner

Add a script to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-storybook": "test-storybook"
  }
}
```

_While storybook is running, run this command in another terminal:_

> yarn test-storybook -- --watch

In the [official documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/writing-tests/interaction-testing)) or [the Testing Handbook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook) we can find more about interaction tests.

## Chromatic

Chromatic is a free publishing service made by the Storybook maintainers. It allows us to deploy and host our Storybook safely and securely in the cloud.

> yarn add -D chromatic

We can log into Chromatic using our GitHub account [here](https://www.chromatic.com/start).

- Create a new project
- Choose a GitHub repo
- Copy the unique project-token
- Build and deploy storybook

> npx chromatic --project-token=<project-token>

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a free CI service that's built into GitHub.

Create a file at `.github/workflows/chromatic.yml`:

```yaml
# Workflow name
name: "Chromatic Deployment"

# Event for the workflow
on: push

# List of jobs
jobs:
  test:
    # Operating System
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Job steps
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - run: yarn
        #ðŸ‘‡ Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow
      - uses: chromaui/action@v1
        # Options required for Chromatic's GitHub Action
        with:
          #ðŸ‘‡ Chromatic projectToken, see https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/deploy/ to obtain it
          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## GitHub Secrets

Secrets are secure environment variables provided by GitHub so that you don't need to hard code the project-token.

## Visual Regression Testing

When we make a PR there will be "ðŸŸ¡ UI Tests" section, where we get notified about changes in the UI.

By having to review these changes we can ensure they don't occur by accident. If a change is intentional, we'll need to update the baseline to compare future tests to the latest version of the story.
