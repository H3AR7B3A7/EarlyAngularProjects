# Unit Testing

Pluralsight course project by Joe Eames.

## Tests

In order of importance:

- Unit Tests
  - Isolated Unit Tests
  - Integrated Unit Tests (including template)
    - Shallow Test
    - Deep Tests (including children)
- (End-to-end Tests)

## Code Coverage

> npm install karma karma-jasmine karma-chrome-launcher karma-jasmine-html-reporter karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter

> ng test --code-coverage

We can now see the code coverage when we open _'coverage/index.html'_ in the browser.
