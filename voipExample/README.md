# VoipExample

A very basic application that allows video conferencing.


## Tasks

- Set up voip with WebRTC
- Make use of components / modules for re-usability where possible
- Make it look nice (with material design?)

- With node:

> node .\server\signalling_server.js

- With Spring

The spring implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/H3AR7B3A7/SignallingServer).
