# Security

Security Design Considerations:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Transport Protection (HTTPS = TLS)
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

Identity providers:

- Google
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Azure Active Directory (v2 / B2C)
- Auth0
- Okta
- Ping Identity
- Identity Server 4
- ...

Client Libraries:

- angular-jwt
- ADAL / MSAL
- oidc-client
